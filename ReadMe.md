# Kai Engelhardt's personal public space

## Work

As a verification architect I
- devise roadmaps for building trustworthy systems,
- re-discover or create verification techniques tailored to these roadmaps,
- design and implement tool prototypes to aid in executing roadmaps, and
- foster an engineering culture where trustworthiness of the product is a key ingredient.

This typically means I do things differently to show what's possible, explain the costs/benefits of introducing more rigorous methods, and educate engineers how to do so, too.
