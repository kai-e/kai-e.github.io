# Kai Engelhardt's personal public space

## Work

As a verification architect I
- devise roadmaps for building trustworthy systems,
- re-discover or create verification techniques tailored to these roadmaps,
- design and implement tool prototypes to aid in executing roadmaps, and
- foster an engineering culture where trustworthiness of the product is a key ingredient.

This often means I do things somewhat differently. If that is the case and the cost/benefit trade-off looks promising, I help with educating engineers how to do things differently, too.
